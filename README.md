# Day Planner
## [Live site](https://andrew836-dev.github.io/dayPlan/)
## What is it?

This is a planner for a single day. There will be 1 hour blocks for standard business hours, 9AM to 5PM. The current day and date is displayed at the top. Tasks and appointments can be added to the text boxes between the time and the blue button. Clicking the blue button will save that task to localStorage, meaning it will stay there if you refresh the page. This is the homework for week 5 of the bootcamp.
